# check
#### Yet another value-validator in JavaScript ... Or is it?

___check___ provides an object (ideally called `check` in lowercase) which has different methods for simple verification and validation of any value.  
I'll describe them using TypeScript style for convenience. Just remember that it is the JavaScript here, and arguments are actually `argument: any`.  
Consider also that the library is baby-aged. Changes that occur may be pretty dramatic.
