#### Yet another value-validator in JavaScript ... Or is it?

`___cheek___` (formerly `_check_`) provides an object (ideally called `cheek` in lowercase) which has various easey-to-use methods to verify and validate any value.  
I'll describe them using TypeScript style for convenience. Just remember that it is the JavaScript here, and arguments are actually `argument: â€¦ | any`.  
Consider also that the library is baby-aged. Changes that occur may be pretty dramatic.
